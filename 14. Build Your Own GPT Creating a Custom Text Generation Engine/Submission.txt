The SFTTrainer is a specialized trainer from the trl library designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning, particularly useful for training large language models on instruction datasets like the one being used. The packing=False argument means that the trainer will not concatenate short sequences together to fill the maximum sequence length. Each training example will be treated as a single, independent sequence. This can be beneficial when the order and context within each individual sequence are important, preventing unintended interactions between unrelated examples.
